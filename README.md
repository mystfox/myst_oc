Myst's various OC stuff. Provides some other's work, and my own creations.
Use with `oppm` to install, or manually look at `programs.cfg` and figure out
what needs to go where.


### License note
Pay *close attention* to licences. While the LGPL in general applies to this
repo and most of it's contents, it includes things like a subtree of a whole
different repo - licensed under different terms. Look in the parent directories
of files for COPYING or LICENSE files, and check the individual files for
license notifications.
